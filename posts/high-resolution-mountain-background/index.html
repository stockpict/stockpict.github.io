The Unicode Consortium, a consortium of device manufacturers, developers and distributors, released the first emoji meta-language in June 2016.
Emoji were created as an amendment to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), which was created in 1892. The first emoji were created for the Western character set and included symbols for joy, anger, fatigue, sadness, and love.</p><p>Since then, emoji have been used to represent different emotions in various cultures around the world. They are now commonly used on social media platforms across all languages.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://stockpict.github.io/tags/wallpaper-list/>Wallpaper List</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://stockpict.github.io/posts/high-resolution-minimalist-desktop-backgrounds/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>High Resolution Minimalist Desktop Backgrounds : Hd Retro Gaming Wallpapers (75+ Images)</span></a>
